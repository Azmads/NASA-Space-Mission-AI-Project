Names for this project: Elizabeth Carrillo, Adam Martinez, Khoi Xa, Juan Zacarias
Project track chosen - Conceptual Design Track
# Brief Project Description
This project focuses on the conceptual design of an AI model to predict climate change by analyzing temperature trends and other contributing factors at a global or regional scale. The objective is to identify key indicators influencing long-term climate changes, providing valuable insights without proposing mitigation strategies. We have selected the Conceptual Design Track, prioritizing the development of a detailed, research-driven solution plan.

### Key aspects of the project include:

Modeling Approach: Employing advanced methodologies such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to facilitate accurate predictions and strong analysis.
Data Sources: Utilizing extensive datasets from the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) to ensure a comprehensive and credible foundation for training the model.
Methodology: Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to clean and preprocess data, select critical features, and structure the dataset for effective model development and validation.
